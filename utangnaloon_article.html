      <p>"Utang Na Loob"</b> as a concept within Filipino culture is not by any means young. The idea of it and the values it carries goes as far back as mid-1500s, the same era in which Filipinos were colonized by the Spanish. Tomas D. Andres', Understanding Filipino Values: A Management Approach, brings in a darker perspective on the concept of Utang na Loob whereby he ties in our history of being colonized as a backdrop to our need to not be ashamed of our actions. <br><br><b>In his paper</b>, he illustrates the dark history of the Colonization period in our history and how the “missionaries” that visited our country from Spain analyzed our behavior and made adjustments to it through the re-education of our faith to be more catholic. <br><br>
      <b>They did this by recognizing a word in our language that translates to shame: hiya,</b> “On the theological side, the concept of hiya (shame) is a better way to explain as compared to guilt to Filipino minds. It is observed by Jerald Whitehouse that the dynamic of shame is predominant in Eastern cultures (as compared to guilt, which is Western). He further suggests the “shame-honor” and not the “guilt-innocence” to explain atonement and sin. Both shame (hiya) and honor (dangal) are values of Filipinos”. (Andres, 1981) <br><br>
The missionaries linked our word <b>for shame to being something more positive as it is Christ-like to have infinite patience and kindness for our neighbor</b>, one’s gratitude or indebtedness is suddenly immeasurable but at the same time exploitable. This can be seen as Spaniards signified by their first warm welcome into our own country and slowly making us foreigners in our own country. This feeling of Utang na Loob has perpetuated throughout the years and culture has let it thrive and follow the footsteps of its originators as our unending gratitude has created a ceaseless debt that can never be fulfilled.
<br><br>
<b>Utang na loob has become an unspoken social cue as it becomes a disruptive obligation and commitment to reciprocate the actions (with or without the desire of help) of other people. </b>
<br><br>
This has then carried on throughout the generations, as a "positive" value among Filipino households. Why the quotations you may ask? Well as of recent years, this term, more specifically its ideologies has been on the radar due to a viral TikTok going viral about a young Asian woman being disowned by her own family by not being able to provide for their lavish purchases. <br><br>
"Utang na Loob" has significant implications for the financial well-being of young adults in the Philippines. Addressing this issue requires a better understanding of the factors contributing to the expectation that children are responsible for taking care of their parents in the future as well as potential solutions to mitigate the negative effects of "Utang na Loob" on parents. The findings of this study can inform said parents so as to promote financial literacy and planning for them and also contribute to the broader understanding of cultural values that affect financial behavior.<br><br>
We, the researchers, had decided to conduct a study focusing on people between the ages of 20 and 42 who have established careers and have the financial means to live stable, independent lives. The researchers dictate that this age range will offer insightful perspectives into the experiences and viewpoints of this generation as they make their way through adulthood with “Utang na Loob”. <b> From the respondent’s answer, it was clear that there is a lack of financial preparedness among most Filipinos as 7 out of 12 respondents stated they had no retirement plans whatsoever during the conducted interviews.</b> <br><br>
Furthermore, the majority who claimed to have no retirement plan were the parent interviewees. In lieu of this, educating both children and parents about financial literacy can help relieve or even solve this problem among Filipino households. Children can learn from said parents about basic money management skills and be taught how to save and invest their money wisely as early as possible. Parents, on the other hand, will at least consider financial literacy programs to learn how to manage their finances effectively, including retirement planning.<br><br>
Financial literacy entails understanding how to manage finances, including saving, budgeting, investing, and debt management. As the respondents under Perception 2 highlight, it is crucial to take a balanced approach to productivity and rest. This includes taking care of one's financial health. One effective way to promote financial literacy is to integrate it into the school curriculum, starting at an early age. This includes educating them about the different types of loans available, the risks and benefits of each loan, and how to avoid falling into a debt trap. 
<br><br>
By providing opportunities for financial inclusion, such as microfinance programs, and promoting economic growth and job creation, households can have access to financial educational resources that can help them avoid falling into debt traps. <br><br>Promoting financial literacy, responsible borrowing practices, and addressing the root causes of debt can help alleviate the perpetuating cycle of debt among Filipino households. By educating both children and parents, we can empower them to make informed financial decisions and improve their financial well-being.
